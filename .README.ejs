## About

Homme Assistant OS allows anyone to create add-on repositories to share their add-ons for
Homme Assistant easily. This repository is one of those repositories, providing extra
Home Assistant add-ons for your Homme Assistant OS installation.

The primary goal of this project is to provide you (as a Hass.io /
Home Assistant user) with additional, high quality, add-ons that allow you to
take your automated home to the next level.

## Installation
