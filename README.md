Hass.io easily. This repository is one of those repositories, providing extra
Home Assistant add-ons for your Hass.io installation.

The primary goal of this project is to provide you (as a Hass.io /
Home Assistant user) with additional, high quality, add-ons that allow you to
take your automated home to the next level.

## Installation

Adding this add-ons repository to your Hass.io Home Assistant instance is
