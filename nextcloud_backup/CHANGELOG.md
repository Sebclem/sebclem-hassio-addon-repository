# V0.16.5

# ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE / REGRESSION ‚ö†Ô∏è 
I have temporary disabled the home assistant sensors.
I suspect my implementation to cause home assistant api flooding. 

I also need feedback to try to fix an issue that some user experiment, if you have any error like `HTTPError: Response code 400 (Bad Request)`, please add your feedback / logs to this issue: [#102](https://github.com/Sebclem/hassio-nextcloud-backup/issues/102). 
At this time, I'm not able to reproduce this error on my setup, so any additional information is welcome.
